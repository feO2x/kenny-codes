In this talk, we explore the fundamentals of performance optimization in .NET, using my library Light.GuardClauses as an example to demonstrate practical techniques for measuring and improving code performance. We use BenchmarkDotNet to showcase and compare performance characteristics of different approaches.

## Event Details

In this session, we’ll discuss how the Open Source library Light.GuardClauses was optimized for performance. We’ll take a look a different methods of the library and compare the performance to the previous version as well as to imperative code. We use BenchmarkDotNet which gives us the ability to write performance measurements in a unit-test-like manner. We’ll also discuss how BenchmarkDotNet executes its measurements internally.
