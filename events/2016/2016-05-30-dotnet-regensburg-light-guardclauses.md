This talk shows you how to use my new library Light.GuardClauses to check parameters easily and make your code more readable.

## Event Details

Building on the January talk about Design by Contract at the .NET User Group Regensburg, the library Light.GuardClauses was developed to provide a simple and flexible way to write precondition checks in production code.
In this session, Kenny Pflug, the author of Light.GuardClauses, introduces the open-source project, demonstrates how to use it effectively, and discusses topics such as performance (with a focus on conditional compilation) and the library’s extensibility.

Anyone who performs parameter validation at the start of their methods can benefit from this library.
