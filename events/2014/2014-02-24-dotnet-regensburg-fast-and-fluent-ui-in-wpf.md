## Event Details

Animations everywhere you look: we are surrounded by touch-enabled smartphones, tablets, and computers that respond instantly to input and bring new life to the screen through elegant shapes and smooth motion. Apple has made its design language one of the strongest aspects of its brand, and Microsoft is likewise revolutionizing user interfaces in Windows Store and Windows Phone apps with its Modern UI.

However, many current line-of-business applications in the Microsoft ecosystem are still desktop applications built with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Can the characteristics of “Fast and Fluent UI,” so prevalent in Windows Store apps, also be applied here to create a better user experience?

This talk explores the question: What makes a user interface feel responsive and fast? We’ll look at the built-in tools and features provided by .NET, Visual Studio, and Blend to create a responsive, fast, and fluent UI with WPF, and we’ll examine the key differences between WinRT and WPF that developers should be aware of.
