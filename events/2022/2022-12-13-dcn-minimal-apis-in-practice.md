## Event Details

ASP.NET Core 6 introduced the so-called “Minimal APIs,” which are intended to eventually replace ASP.NET Core MVC for building Web APIs.
But how well-suited is this technology for production use?

In this talk, we’ll take a look under the hood and discuss structure, performance, authentication, Swagger support, dependency injection, and automated testing with this new endpoint-based technology. We’ll also take a look ahead at the new features introduced with .NET 7 and examine where challenges and limitations still remain today.
