Talk about ASP.NET Core 6 Minimal APIs - how they work, their benefits and drawbacks, and how to structure your solutions.

<!-- truncate -->

## Event Details

ASP.NET Core 6 introduces Minimal APIs which are intended to eventually replace ASP.NET Core MVC for building Web APIs.
But how well-suited is this technology for production use?

In this talk, we’ll take a look under the covers and discuss structure, performance, authentication, Swagger support, dependency injection, and automated testing with this new endpoint-based approach. We’ll also provide a preview of the improvements likely coming with .NET 7 and highlight the current limitations and challenges.
