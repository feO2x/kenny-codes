Talk about how to modernize legacy .NET Framework applications step-by-step.

<!-- truncate -->

## Event Details

We all know them — and many of us maintain them: applications that have been running and evolving for years, if not decades.
Often, these still rely on older .NET Framework versions such as 4.5 or even 4.0, leaving developers longing for the modern features of C# and the .NET runtime.

In this talk, we’ll explore how to take advantage of newer language and runtime features — such as `Span<T>`, records, and nullable reference types — even within legacy projects. We’ll also discuss strategies for gradually improving development in aging applications by decoupling code and creating “islands of joy” that are easier to maintain and test automatically. Finally, we’ll examine the pros and cons of upgrading to .NET 6.
