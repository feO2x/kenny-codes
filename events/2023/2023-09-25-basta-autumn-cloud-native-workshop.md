Practical cloud-native development with modern end-to-end architectures.

<!-- truncate -->

## Event Details

Whether you’re modernizing you apps or starting fresh, everything is expected to be cloud-native these days. But what does “cloud-native” actually mean? Do we really always need stateless microservices everywhere? In this full-day workshop,  Thorsten Hans and Kenny Pflug use distributed application architectures and proven patterns to show you how to build cloud-native applications. Through hands-on examples, .NET architects and developers will examine common challenges and discuss pragmatic solutions. Whether your target is on-prem infrastructure, a private data center, or a public cloud like Azure, get your team ready to design applications around essential cloud-native attributes such as configurability, observability, resilience, and scalability.
