## Event Details

For more than a decade, async await has been an integral part of C# and .NET.
But what actually happens under the hood when we write an asynchronous method?

In this talk, we’ll take a deep dive into the topic and explore several key aspects: why async/await is crucial for usability in desktop applications and scalability in services, what the state machine generated by the C# compiler from an async method looks like, and how this state machine behaves at runtime.

We’ll also discuss common pitfalls and performance considerations. This knowledge will enable you to design and implement asynchronous code optimally in your own projects.
