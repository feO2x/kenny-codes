This workshop focusses on building Cloud-Native .NET backends with Aspire and integrating AI into it with Microsoft.Extension.AI

## Event Details

Cloud-native backends are the go-to solution for many use cases when it comes to scalability, resilience, and availability — but how can AI be integrated effectively?

In this workshop, we use .NET Aspire to host multiple services, including a YARP gateway and Duende Identity Server as the identity provider (IdP). Within this backend, we integrate both AI models such as GPT-5.x via the OpenAI API and locally running models via Ollama (appropriate hardware required).

We will cover both prompt design and securing such backends using the BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) pattern.

For the workshop, a computer with the .NET 10 SDK and Docker or Podman is required.
