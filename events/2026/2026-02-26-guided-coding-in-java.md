In the past two years, I've been working extensively with different Coding Agents and came up with a methodology called Guided Coding. I present it for the first time in this stream with Johannes Rabauer.

## Event Details

Vibe Coding is all about working fast with Coding Agents and not caring about what happens on the code level. While this is nice for rapid prototyping, it is not an appropriate approach for writing enterprise-ready production code.

I've been working with Coding Agents since 2024, and over the time, I came up with a methodology that I call "Guided Coding". It is not as fast as Vibe Coding, but you stay in control of the code base by writing plans, implementing them, and then guiding the agent in an iterative process. In my experience, speedups of 1.25x to 4x are possible, depending on the task.
