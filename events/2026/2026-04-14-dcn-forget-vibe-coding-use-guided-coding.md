In this talk, we'll explore Guided Coding, an approach that I developed in early 2026 during the development of Light.PortableResults to improve my development speed with Coding Agents while staying in control of the code base.

## Event Details

In this talk, we will explore why Vibe Coding is interesting for rapid prototyping, but quickly reaches its limits when designing complex enterprise software. As an alternative, we will take a look at Guided Coding - an iterative approach in which AI coding agents are deliberately steered through three different phases.

This allows you to develop faster (a speedup of 1.25x to 4x is not unrealistic) while still maintaining control over your codebase. We will also examine concrete examples of AI rules, AI plans, and prompts based on the development of the .NET library [Light.PortableResults](https://github.com/feO2x/Light.PortableResults).

Along the way, we will discuss the particular characteristics of coding agents and LLMs, as well as security aspects.
