## Event Details

Version control systems have become an indispensable part of modern software development.
In this talk, we’ll explore the topic from two perspectives: first, through a hands-on look at Git, where we’ll examine the details of repositories, commits, branches, and merges. Second, we’ll compare centralized and distributed version control systems — specifically Subversion and Git — and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

We’ll conclude with an overview of GitHub, the open-source development platform that has fundamentally changed how developers collaborate on software projects.
