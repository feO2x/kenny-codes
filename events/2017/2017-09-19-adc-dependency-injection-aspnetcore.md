## Event Details

In ASP.NET Core applications, the dependency injection container has become a core feature, allowing us to flexibly resolve object graphs. In this talk, we’ll take a look at how DI containers work under the covers, explore the different DI frameworks available, and discuss how to apply dependency injection effectively in our ASP.NET Core web apps — even at the boundaries of the application, such as database access and handling serialized input data.
