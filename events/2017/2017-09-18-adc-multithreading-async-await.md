## Event Details

Multithreading and Asynchronous Programming are indispensable in nearly every web application. In this talk, we’ll look behind the scenes of threads and the thread pool, explain why asynchronous I/O access is so important for performance and scalability, and show how we can use this knowledge to design our ASP.NET Core web apps more effectively.
