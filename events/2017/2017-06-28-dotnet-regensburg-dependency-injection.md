In ASP.NET Core applications, the Dependency Injection (DI) container has become a fundamental component.
It allows us to flexibly resolve object graphs — but what’s really happening behind registrations, lifetimes, the different types of Dependency Injection, and object composition?

In this talk, we’ll dive into the internal architecture of DI containers to understand exactly what occurs when an object graph is resolved. We’ll also discuss common patterns and anti-patterns in Dependency Injection, explore how the principle can be applied to data loading from databases or web services, and examine how it fits within the broader context of the SOLID principles.
