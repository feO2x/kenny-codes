## Event Details

**Time:** 10:30

With .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web APIs can, for the first time, be compiled using Native AOT and delivered directly as machine code.
Microsoft promises smaller application sizes, faster startup times, and reduced memory consumption at runtime. That sounds impressive — but how significant are these gains in practice?

Which frameworks, libraries, and components can be used, and which are (not yet) compatible with Native AOT? Can reflection features still be utilized, or are they unavailable with Native AOT? How can a Native AOT app be effectively tested?

This one-hour session explores all of these questions, helping you determine whether Native AOT is a practical and beneficial choice for your projects.

This webinar provides a comprehensive overview of .NET Native AOT compilation, including performance benefits, limitations, and use cases. Learn when and how to leverage Native AOT for your .NET applications.
