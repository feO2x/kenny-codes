**Time:** 10:30

Interest in Native AOT has grown significantly since .NET 8 introduced the ability to deliver ASP.NET Core applications directly as machine code.
However, a major challenge remains: Entity Framework Core is currently not compatible with Native AOT.

In this session, we explore alternative approaches for designing the data access layer in Native AOT projects. We’ll examine various micro-ORMs and demonstrate how to use Humble Objects (database sessions) to clearly separate business logic from the data access layer. The goal is to create a structure that feels almost as seamless as working with EF Core.

We’ll also take a closer look at patterns such as Unit of Work and Repository, discussing how these can be effectively leveraged to build a clean and maintainable codebase.
