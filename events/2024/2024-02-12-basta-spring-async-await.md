Fundamentals and practical tips for building scalable .NET apps with async/await.

<!-- truncate -->

## Event Details

For over a decade, async/await has been part of C#/.NET.
But what actually happens when we write an asynchronous method?
In this talk, Kenny Pflug takes you on an in-depth tour covering the following topics: 

- why async/await is important for scalability in ASP.NET Core services and for UX in desktop apps
- what the state machine generated by the C# compiler from an async method looks like and how this state machine behaves at runtime.
- We’ll also take a look at potential pitfalls and performance considerations — especially when using third-party libraries that appear to support async/await.

This knowledge will help you design asynchronous code optimally in your projects.
