Large Language Models are currently one of the most exciting technologies for application developers — now supporting not only text, but also vision.
But how can they be efficiently integrated into .NET-based backends?

In this talk, we’ll provide a comprehensive overview of use cases and prompt design, demonstrated through a complex form that we’ll complete using text, speech, and images. We’ll take a close look at OpenAI’s .NET API, host our backend services with .NET Aspire, and also discuss strategies for securing those backend services.
