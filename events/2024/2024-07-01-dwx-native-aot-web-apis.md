Building Web APIs with ASP.NET Core Native AOT compilation.

<!-- truncate -->

## Event Details

With .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web APIs can, for the first time, be compiled using Native AOT and delivered directly as machine code.
Microsoft promises smaller application sizes, faster startup times, and lower memory consumption at runtime. That sounds impressive — but how substantial are these gains in practice?

Which frameworks, libraries, and components can be used, and which are (not yet) compatible with Native AOT? How should the data access layer be structured when Entity Framework Core is not an option? Can reflection features still be used, or is this completely restricted by Native AOT? How can a Native AOT app be tested? And is it possible to use the managed debugger in the IDE?

In this one-hour session, Kenny explores all of these questions, helping you determine whether Native AOT is a practical and worthwhile path for your projects.
