At this meetup, we explore how we can integrate OpenAI’s .NET API into modern .NET Cloud Native backends, focusing on the use case of AI Information Extraction.

Large Language Models are currently one of the most exciting technologies for application developers — now supporting not only text, but also vision.
But how can they be efficiently integrated into .NET-based backends?

In this talk, we’ll provide a comprehensive overview of use cases and prompt design, demonstrated through a complex form that we’ll complete using text, speech, and images. We’ll take a close look at OpenAI’s .NET API, host our backend services with .NET Aspire, and also discuss strategies for securing those backend services.
