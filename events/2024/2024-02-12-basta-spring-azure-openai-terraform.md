Securely deploying Azure OpenAI Service with Terraform for private GPT LLMs and stream results to Angular frontends.

<!-- truncate -->

## Event Details

Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service provides the capability to integrate pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 Turbo, into applications and business processes.
However, beyond programmatic access, important questions arise around deployment and hosting:

- How can the Azure OpenAI Service and the desired LLMs be provisioned declaratively using Terraform?
- How can the service be integrated into a virtual, private network infrastructure?
- How can access to the LLM be controlled and restricted?
- What about data residency and data sovereignty — can it be guaranteed that data remains within the EU or Germany?
- And how can response streaming be implemented for frontend applications?

This talk addresses all of these questions, enabling you to determine whether the Azure OpenAI Service is a suitable option for your organization and how it can be effectively integrated into existing or new cloud infrastructures.
