Workshop focusing on async/await internals and expert knowledge for scalable .NET applications.

## Event Details

async and await have been integral parts of Microsoft’s .NET ecosystem for years — yet subtle bugs and performance issues can easily creep into our codebases through improper use of asynchronous programming. But that ends here!

In this full-day workshop, we’ll start from the fundamentals and look behind the scenes: What impact does async-and-await have on the .NET thread pool and on the scalability of ASP.NET Core applications? Which data access libraries support async/await, which do not — and how can we determine this? What does the state machine generated by the C# compiler behind an async method actually look like, and how does it behave at runtime?

We’ll also explore the differences between async I/O and async compute, and discuss when sync-over-async might make sense. All of this is paired with plenty of hands-on exercises — refactoring code to use async/await correctly, as well as reviewing common anti-patterns to avoid in your own projects.

This workshop equips you with the expert knowledge you need to design and implement asynchronous code effectively in your .NET applications.
