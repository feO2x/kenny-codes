## Event Details

Large Language Models are currently one of the most exciting technologies for application developers — now supporting not only text, but also speech and vision.
But how can they be efficiently integrated into cloud-native, .NET-based backends?

This talk provides a comprehensive overview of use cases and prompt design, demonstrated through a complex form that we’ll complete using text, speech, and images. We’ll use Microsoft.Extensions.AI to enable unified access to different language models, host our backend services with .NET Aspire, and also address the topic of securing backend services using the Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern.
