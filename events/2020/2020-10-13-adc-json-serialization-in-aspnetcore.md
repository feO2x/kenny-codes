## Event Details

They are part of almost every HTTP request, yet we hardly notice them: JSON documents. In this talk we’ll look under the covers of ASP.NET Core and take a close look at how JSON serializers are used and how they work. In particular, we will compare JSON.NET (Newtonsoft.Json) with the new System.Text.Json serializer, which has been the default serializer since ASP.NET Core 3, in terms of features and performance. Utf8Json will join the picture to show what is possible when you optimize for performance and memory usage.
