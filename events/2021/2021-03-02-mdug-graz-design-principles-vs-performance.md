In this talk, I'll explore the tension between established design patterns and modern performance considerations in .NET development and explore how my growing knowledge about .NET internals has shaped the design of my software.

## Event Details

The SOLID principles, along with many design patterns and best practices, have long shaped the design and architecture of line-of-business (LOB) applications and are considered by many developers as the foundation for implementing business requirements.
In recent years, however, performance optimization has taken on a new level of importance — not only because many cloud applications are billed based on memory usage and compute time. Microsoft itself has emphasized performance with .NET Core and now .NET 5.

In this talk, we’ll contrast the insights gained from performance optimization with the established design principles and patterns, discussing what conclusions we must draw to produce code that is both testable and maintainable — yet scales efficiently by default. We’ll focus in particular on asynchronous programming and memory behavior in the context of common design principles and patterns.
