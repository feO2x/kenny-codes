## Event Details

Automated testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD) have become widely known among software developers, especially with the rise of agile methodologies — but how can these techniques be applied efficiently in everyday programming?

Using live code examples in Visual Studio, this talk demonstrates which frameworks are available in the .NET ecosystem for writing and running automated tests, how to integrate testing into the daily development workflow, which types of tests developers typically encounter, what TDD truly means, and what advantages and challenges come with writing automated regression tests.

In addition, we’ll explore several object-oriented principles and design patterns that help keep test code well-structured, maintainable, and easy to extend.
