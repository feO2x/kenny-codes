# AGENTS.md for AI Plans

In this folder, we only keep Markdown files for AI plans. Each file has a four-digit prefix which corresponds to the GitHub issue number.

## How to Write Plans

1. Each plan consists of exactly the three following elements: a rationale, acceptance criteria, and technical details.
2. A retionale describes the overarching goal of the plan. Keep this concise, only elaborate when special circumstances require it. Use free text in this section of the plan.
3. Acceptance criteria is a list of requirements that must be met for the plan to be considered complete. Use check marks `- [ ]` for these in Markdown.
4. Technical details describes the changes on a technical level. Which classes and members should be extended, which
   design patterns should be used? How do we ensure performance? Avoid going into too much detail (do not write the
   finished implementation), but focus on the high-level design and how things are connected. It should give the
   implementer a clear picture of what needs to be done, but also give her or him freedom to implement the plan in a way
   that she or he deems best. The length of this section is highly dependent on the task that the plan addresses.
5. Regarding automated tests: it is usually enough to note that 'automated tests need to be written' as one check mark
   in the acceptance criteria list. If there are special requirements for the tests, these can be elaborated in the
   technical details section. But normally, you can simply leave these technical details out if the automated tests can
   be written in a straightforward way.
6. When a plan should involve micro benchmarks, these need to be included in the acceptance criteria list and optionally in the technical details section. As with automated tests, if the BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks can be written in a straightforward way, leave out the technical details.
